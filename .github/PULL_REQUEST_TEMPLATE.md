The following labels control the deployment of this PR if they’re applied. Please choose which should be applied, then apply them to this PR:

| Label                  | Description                             | Use case                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `skip-deploy`          | The entire deployment can be skipped.   | This might be the case for a small fix, a tweak to documentation or something like that.                                         |
| `skip-web-deploy`      | The web tier can be skipped.            | This is the case if you're working on code that doesn't affect the front end, like management commands, tasks, or documentation. |
| `skip-celery-deploy`   | Deployment to celery can be skipped.    | This is the case if you make no changes to tasks.py or the code that tasks rely on.                                              |
| `skip-cronjob-deploy`  | Deployment to cron jobs can be skipped. | This is the case if no changes are made that affect cronjobs.                                                                    |
| `skip-daemon-deploy`   | Deployment of daemons can be skipped    | This is the case if you haven't updated daemons or the code they depend on                                                       |

**If deployment is required:**

- What extra steps are needed to deploy this beyond the standard deploy?
- Do scripts need to be run or things like that?
- If this is more than a quick thing, a new issue should be created in our infra repo: https://github.com/freelawproject/infrastructure/issues/new (if you don’t have access to it, just put the steps here)
